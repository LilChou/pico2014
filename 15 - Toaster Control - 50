open the website
try the commands

we can found that
the url has a form of "http://web2014.picoctf.com/toaster-control-1040194/handler.php?action=command"

so we change the action to "Shutdown & Turn Off"
but it doesn't fot the rule of url encoding

so i read "http://www.url-encode-decode.com/" for reference
and found the correct url="http://web2014.picoctf.com/toaster-control-1040194/handler.php?action=Shutdown+%26+Turn+Off"
