in the code we can find that

fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
printf(name);

so we can exploit the printf function

we can give it a %i to know what is in the stack next

we connect by "nc vuln2014.picoctf.com 4546"

and print something in

then we can find out that the number it's asking

might be the fourth in the stack 

so when it ask for our name to insult us

we gave him "%i %i %i %i"

and the fourth num is the number it's asking

after giving the num

we will get the flag : leak_the_seakret
