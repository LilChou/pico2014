from the c code, we knew that we have to find the location of the variable “secret”

so, here’s the solution

first we use gdb to find the location of the variable

we type “gdb ./write_right” to enter the gdb environment

and then type “p &secret” to get the address -- 804a03c



after getting the address

we run the write_right and tell it we want to write thing to address 804a03c

and we write 1337beef on it



finally we get the flag “arbitrary_write_is_always_right”
